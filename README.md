# LoanMaster
LoanMaster is a mock-up loaning website where people who do not have the complex documents and information for a loan, can easily apply for one here and
get their loaning done. The idea was that LoanMaster would partner with small banks offering to help provide loans for small communities and people and
hence help them get their loan. It only asks for thier aadhar id and some information on their family to determine their credit score and
if their loan can be approved.
